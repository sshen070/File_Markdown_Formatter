# Airport Geodetic Control Survey Work

Establishing geodetic control provides accuracy for aeronautical information, engineering surveys, and mapping to support planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and management of airport facilities. This control establishes a tie to the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), providing a common set of geographical coordinates relative to other parts of the National Airspace System.

## Reconnaissance Activities

Reconnaissance activities for each survey must include reviewing station descriptions in the NGS database, coordinating with airport authorities, mark recovery, selecting PACS, SACS, and NSRS ties, preparing required documentation, compiling a Project Survey Plan, and discussing future construction plans. Control stations (survey marks) must be considered for use in these projects.

## Types of Control Stations

* Horizontal: All control stations with stability codes A, B, or C, and high-accuracy GPS control stations.
* Vertical: First-order and second-order NAVD 88 vertical control stations within the project area.

## NSRS Tie

All horizontal and vertical points used as control must be NSRS published stations. Database Search:
Perform a database search for all control stations on and around the airport meeting the criteria prior to performing field reconnaissance.

Mark Recovery:
Search for suitable control stations found during the database search. Use existing marks before setting a new monument, reducing mark setting costs and maintaining an accurate survey database.

## Contractor Responsibilities

Prepare digital updated descriptions or recovery notes in NGS format for all NSRS marks searched for and used in the project. Perform mark maintenance as required, including replacing logo cap lids if missing.

## Mark Not Found

If a mark is not found, enter the number of person-hours spent searching for it in the digital recovery note. If strong evidence suggests a mark is destroyed, clearly state the evidence so NGS can determine if it's destroyed and replace it as required.

## Intervisibility Choices for PACS and SACS

The intervisibility choices are: all three stations are intervisible with each other, the PACS is intervisible with both SACS but they're not intervisible with each other, or the PACS is intervisible with one SACS while both SACS are intervisible with each other.

## Stability Codes

Stability codes A, B, and C are defined in the Blue Book. Only codes A and B are recommended for new PACS. Concrete posts can be selected with code C stability if deemed stable from review of soil conditions and average frost depth.

## Stamping

New PACS must have a unique stamping. Marks set at an airport with an official FAA location identifier must be stamped with that identifier, followed by a sequential letter, and the year the mark was set.

## Control Station Selection Priorities and Siting Requirements

Existing marks can be used as control stations (PACS) if they meet stability codes A or B. For concrete marks with stability code C, seven requirements must be met: the disk already exists, the monument is poured in place in concrete, it's a triangulation station, reference mark, azimuth mark, or bench mark bearing the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey logo, set below the frost line, in non-expansive soils, shows no evidence of movement, and meets siting requirements.

## Monument Accessibility

PACS and SACS must be accessible to survey crews, allowing for unattended setup of GPS equipment without hindering airport operations. They should allow setup of both conventional and satellite surveying equipment. SACS should be sited on high ground near the approach end of primary runways for better utilization in obstruction surveys.

## Monument Siting Considerations

When siting monuments, consider the following items: adequate GPS satellite visibility, accessibility by vehicle, stability (bedrock preferred), permanency, ease of recovery, minimal multi-path, appropriate geographic location and spacing, efficient use by surveying community, public accessibility, no potential conflict with future development, aerial-photo identifiable.

## PACS Proximity to Other Airport Features

PACS should be at least 400 meters apart from each other. If an existing control station is used, it should be at least 15 meters from a runway edge. PACS and/or SACS must not be within 305 meters of the critical side of certain airport features.

## Vector Processing Results

Vector processing results must check within 1 cm for north and east components and 3 cm for up (ellipsoidal height) component. GPS observations must be performed using geodetic quality dual frequency receivers, with fixed height tripods used whenever practical. Tripod stability, plumb alignment, and height verification are required at the beginning and end of each project. Optical plungers on Tribrachs must be checked before and after observations.

## Checking Descriptions

Descriptions must be written by one person and checked by another. Recovery notes should also be checked. For example, a mark setter can draft a description immediately after setting the mark, and an observer can check the description during observations.

## New Descriptions

A complete new three-paragraph description is required for:
* A new mark set
* An existing mark without a PID (Permanent Identification Number)
* An existing mark without an NSRS digital description
* An existing mark with only a brief description not meeting the three-paragraph requirement
* An existing mark's description that is no longer accurate or complete

## Description Format

The first paragraph of a description includes:
* The cardinal or intercardinal point of the compass from three nearest, well-known mapped geographic features
* Distances in kilometers (followed by miles) or meters (followed by feet), recorded to one decimal place

The second paragraph is a route description that starts from a definite point, such as an intersection of named or numbered main highways or a well-known geographical feature. The format for the first leg of the "to reach" paragraph includes:
* FROM THE MAIN POST OFFICE IN DOWNTOWN SMITHVILLE or FROM THE INTERSECTION OF INTERSTATE XX AND STATE HIGHWAY YY
* A direction (north, northeast, northerly, northeasterly)
* ON A ROAD (name or number of road or highway or both if it has both a name and number)
* FOR A DISTANCE (kilometers followed by miles in parentheses)

The third paragraph includes measurements:
* The station mark type
* How the mark is set (include size and shape of concrete post, if applicable)
* Reference measurements (start with furthest permanent object)
* The handheld GPS position
* PACS or SACS designation, if appropriate

## Terminology

Correct NGS survey terminology must be used in all station descriptions and reports.
